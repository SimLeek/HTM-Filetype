#HTM Filetype

A corruption tolerant filetype for saving neurogenesis/neurodegeneration enabled HTM neural networks

##Testing

For running the network, once it's implemented, no packages need to be installed. However, for testing and debugging, vtk is necessary for visualizations and unittest is necessary for unit testing.
